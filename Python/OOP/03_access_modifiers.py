"""
In Python, we can impose access restrictions on different data members and member functions. 
The restrictions are specified through access modifiers. 
Access modifiers are tags we can associate with each member to define which parts of the program can access it directly.

There are two types of access modifiers in Python. Letâ€™s take a look at them one by one.
